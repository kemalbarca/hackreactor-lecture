soal :
Write a function called "calculateBillTotal".

Given the pre tax and pre tip amount of a meal, "calculateBillTotal" returns the total amount due after tax and tip.

Notes:
* Assume that sales tax is 9.5% and tip is 15%.
* Do NOT tip on the sales tax, only on the pre tip amount.

contoh :
var output = calculateBillTotal(20);
console.log(output); // --> 24.9

jawaban :
function calculateBillTotal(preTaxAndTipAmount) {
  // your code here
  var tax = preTaxAndTipAmount * (0.095);
  var tip = preTaxAndTipAmount * (0.15);
  var total = preTaxAndTipAmount + tax + tip;
  return total;
}
